# Internship Tasks - C++ Game Projects <br>

# Overview <br>
This repository contains four C++ game projects completed as part of my internship at InternPe. These projects showcase fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and game logic implementation.<br>

# Projects Included <br>
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Guess The Number <br>
A simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Hints are provided to guide the player. <br>
üîπ Concepts Used: Random number generation, loops, conditionals.<br>
How to Play:<br>
1. The game randomly selects a number.<br>
2. The player enters their guess.<br>
3. The game provides hints like "Guess Higher" or "Guess Lower".<br>
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.<br>

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rock-Paper-Scissors<br>
A classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player competes against the computer.<br>
üîπ Concepts Used: Randomization, string handling, conditionals.<br>
How to Play:<br>
1. The player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.<br>
2. The computer randomly chooses one of the three.<br>
3. The winner is determined based on game rules.<br>

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tic-Tac-Toe<br>
A two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played on a 3x3 grid.<br>
üîπ Concepts Used: 2D arrays, loops, user input handling.<br>
How to Play:<br>
1. Players take turns choosing a position on the 3x3 board.<br>
2. The game checks for a win condition (three in a row, column, or diagonal).<br>
3. If no spaces remain and no winner is found, the game ends in a draw.<br>

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Four<br>
A two-player Connect Four game played on a 6x7 board.<br>
üîπ Concepts Used: 2D arrays, loops, game state validation.<br>
How to Play:<br>
1. Players take turns dropping tokens into columns.<br>
2. The goal is to connect four pieces in a row, column, or diagonally.<br>
3. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.<br>

# Installation & Usage<br>
To run any of the games, follow these steps:<br>

1. Clone the repository:<br>
[https://github.com/TusharSatpathy01/InternPE.git]<br>

2. Navigate to the project folder:<br>
cd internpe-tasks<br>

3. Compile and run any game using a C++ compiler:<br>
g++ guess_the_number.cpp -o guess_game<br>
./guess_game<br>

(Replace guess_the_number.cpp with the respective game file.)<br>


# Acknowledgment<br>
These projects were developed as part of my internship at InternPe, showcasing my learning and hands-on experience in C++ game development.<br>
